# Hackintosh-Ryzen-5600x-MSI-B550

AMD Ryzen 5600x + MSI MPG B550 Gaming Plus + MSI Radeon 6600XT

My daily-driver OpenCore config for my AMD rig. Mobo is an MSI B550 MPG Gaming Plus with a Ryzen 5600x. For graphics it runs on a MSI Radeon 6600XT. In Geekbench 6 Metal it scores 124k.

Overall everything works as expected, including sleep and all USB. I have onboard audio disabled in favor of a FiiO E17k "Alpine II" USB DAC.
One slight inconvenience is having to keep Resizable-Bar disabled in UEFI if I want sleep to function properly.
